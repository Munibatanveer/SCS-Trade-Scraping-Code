# SCS-Trade-Scraping-Code
This project involves web scraping of the SCS Trade website, a dynamic financial platform that loads content via JavaScript. Due to the nature of the website, traditional scraping techniques (like requests and BeautifulSoup) were insufficient. To overcome this, I implemented browser automation tools (such as Selenium or Playwright) to render and extract data from dynamically loaded elements. The website heavily relies on JavaScript, which required handling asynchronous content rendering. Navigating and interacting with elements like dropdowns, buttons, and paginated tables demanded robust automation logic. Despite these challenges, the scraper reliably fetches key financial data, which can be further used for analysis or integration into dashboards.
