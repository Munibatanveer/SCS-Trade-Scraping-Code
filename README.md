# SCS-Trade-Scraping-Code
This project involves web scraping of the SCS Trade website, a dynamic financial platform that loads content via JavaScript. Due to the nature of the website, traditional scraping techniques (like requests and BeautifulSoup) were insufficient. To overcome this, I implemented browser automation tools such as Selenium.
